Welcome to the **Document Summarizer Web Application**, a powerful tool for extracting and summarizing text from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files. This project leverages Flask for the web interface, NLTK for natural language processing, and free, open-source libraries like `pdfplumber` and `python-docx` for file handling. It supports both extractive and abstractive summarization, offering a user-friendly interface with user authentication, database storage, and error handling.

## Features
- **Text Extraction**: Supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT files using `pdfplumber`, `python-docx`, and robust file reading.
- **Summarization Types**:
  - **Extractive**: Selects key sentences based on word frequency, excluding stopwords.
  - **Abstractive**: Generates concise summaries by combining key sentences (simplified approach).
- **User Authentication**: Secure login/register functionality with Flask-SQLAlchemy and SQLite.
- **Persistent Storage**: Stores summaries in a database for later viewing.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Bootstrap 5 for a clean, mobile-friendly interface.
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of file formats, encoding issues, and missing dependencies.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DocSummarizer.git
   cd DocSummarizer
Create a virtual environment (recommended):
bash
Wrap
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies: The app will automatically install required packages (nltk, pdfplumber, python-docx) on first run, but you can manually install them:
bash
Wrap
Copy
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy nltk pdfplumber python-docx
Ensure NLTK resources are downloaded: Run the following in Python to manually download punkt and stopwords:
python
Wrap
Copy
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
Run the application:
bash
Wrap
Copy
python app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000. Use the demo credentials demo/demo123 to log in.
Usage
Upload a File: Use the web interface to upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files.
Select Summarization Type: Choose between extractive (key sentences) or abstractive summarization.
View Results: See the summary on the results page, with options to copy it or return to upload more documents.
Previous Summaries: View past summaries on the upload page.

Algorithms and Logic
Text Extraction: Uses pdfplumber for PDFs, python-docx for DOCX, and file reading for TXT with encoding fallbacks.
Extractive Summarization: Scores sentences by word frequency (excluding stopwords) using NLTK, selecting the top N sentences.
Abstractive Summarization: Combines key sentences from extractive summarization, truncating to a maximum length.
For a detailed explanation, see the Logic and Algorithm section in this README or the code comments.
